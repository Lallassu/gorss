## About
Simple RSS/Atom reader written in Golang. Highly configurable and with themes.

## Usage
Tarballs with prebuilt binaries for both Linux and OSX can be found under release page.

Just start by running either `gorss_linux` or `gorss_osx` binary from the tarballs.

You can also specify theme, configuration and database manually.
```
./gorss -config gorss.conf -theme default.theme -db mydb.db
```

If either the configuration or theme files are not specified, gorss will attempt
to use`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gorss/gorss.conf` and
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gorss/themes/default.theme`, respectively.  These files will be
created from the defaults if not present.

To build and run use the makefile.
```
make run
```

In order to cross-compile `make release` for Linux on OSX you need to install the following:
```
brew install FiloSottile/musl-cross/musl-cross
```

The database `gorss.db` will be automatically created in your systems 'Data Home' directory. You can specify which database
to use with the argument `-db` to the binary.

and name fields. (See the example below for supported options).
```
./gorss -config my.conf
```

```
